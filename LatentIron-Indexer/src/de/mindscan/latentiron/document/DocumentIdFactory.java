/**
 * 
 * A DocumentId is calculated from a location of a document. 
 * 
 * Each location should result for the most time in a unique document id. This makes the forward step, 
 * if a query asks for a document at a particular location easy. Also all Paths in between can also be 
 * calculated, without some kind of inverse index.
 * 
 * Attention: 
 * 
 * But this also means, you can enumerate the indexed directories. It depends on your security requirements
 * whether this is a desired feature or not. A search engine for public code may be able to do this trade-off. 
 * If your thread model differs, you might need a secure DocumentId function, where the directories can not
 * be enumerated using a dictionary attack or something similar. You may avoid dictionary lookups by a signing
 * key for for each requested DocumentId. But maybe even then you may still be exploitable by measuring timing
 * information.
 * 
 * The cryptographic hash function used is MD5.
 * 
 * Our reason to use this hash function is not necessarily for security but we use its property to rarely
 * produce collisions.
 * 
 * For a search engine we also want to efficiently know, whether a certain Path or URL is already in the 
 * index. This kind of information can be stored in a BloomFilter without accessing the index. The appealing
 * thing is, that the index, can be stored in a flat manner and can be scaled/distributed horizontally, but
 * can also managed to be saved in a directory structure. by using parts of the DocumentId (the hash code)
 * as the "directory"-key.
 * 
 * If you want to be able to de-duplicate the documents you would choose a DocumentID based on the content
 * hash or a keyed MAC.
 *
 * A combination of both allows a de-duplication and a flat storage.
 * 
 * If you need security a totally random DocumentId would be the way to go. That means we might be interested
 * in different strategies for finding documents.
