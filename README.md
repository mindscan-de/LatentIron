# SilentFeed

The idea for this tool is to implement an image/video dataset labeling tool with the possibility to build
and export datasets using these labels. As in my previous implementations, this will be implemeted without
a need for a database. All data will be again kept in a file structure, which basically acts as a database.

Some of the code will be take-overs from my source code search engine combined with with some insigths from 
multiple other projects, where I accessed FastAPI web services from a GUI. Such web services can be used to
use other pretrained models generate and then to store the extracted labels for images and make their content
searchable.

Probably SilentFeed will be a precursor of another tool which i had in mind to model Real-World-Data with a
DAG using some triple grammars. But I will keep keep this idea for later.

This tool should mainly serve my own needs. Therefore please refrain from any suggestions or bug reports.
